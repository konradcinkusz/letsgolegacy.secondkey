/**
 * check-papers.mjs — the LaTeX documents in this repository hold the house
 * style, and their language editions stay in step.
 *
 * See architecture-standards, docs/research/00-RESEARCH-DOCUMENTATION.md,
 * "Checking the papers". Copy this file to <repo>/scripts/check-papers.mjs,
 * fill in the CONFIGURATION block below, and run it in the same lint job as
 * the repository's other documentation checks.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 *   The house preamble's whole claim is that a document from any repository
 *   in the estate looks like it came from the same shop. That claim was false
 *   and nothing said so: `ab-ove`'s two overview editions carried none of the
 *   seven house markers — not the colors, the section formatting, the header,
 *   the status marker, the path macro, the geometry or the link style — while
 *   `agent-eval-bench` and `marcus-shop` carried all seven. A convention
 *   about copying a preamble correctly has nothing to fail, so it failed
 *   quietly for as long as nobody diffed two PDFs side by side.
 *
 *   The Beamer theme, distributed over the same period as a FILE rather than
 *   a block to copy, propagated byte-identically. That is the lesson this
 *   check enforces: \input the house preamble, do not retype it.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
 *
 *   It checks four things, all of them mechanical:
 *
 *     R1  Every document root \inputs the house preamble.
 *     R2  Every document root defines the preamble's contract before that
 *         \input, so a missing \headerleft is a named lint failure rather
 *         than an "Undefined control sequence" eighty lines into a CI log.
 *     R3  The repository's copy of the house preamble still matches the one
 *         it was taken from, by digest.
 *     R4  Language editions come in pairs, neither half is edited alone, and
 *         a document with editions calls its figures through \dgm rather than
 *         writing a rendered path by hand.
 *
 *   It does NOT compile anything. A build is what catches a broken document;
 *   this catches a document that builds perfectly and is wrong anyway, which
 *   is the failure a green pipeline hides. Run both.
 *
 *   It does NOT check that a translation is correct — no script can. R4's
 *   coupling half checks that somebody looked, which is the failure that
 *   actually bites: a figure renumbered in one edition and left stale in the
 *   other, with nothing going red.
 *
 * Zero dependencies: this runs in the same job as the repository's other
 * documentation checks.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/check-papers.mjs [base-ref]
 * Exit:  0 = conformant, and coupled if a base ref was given; 1 = not.
